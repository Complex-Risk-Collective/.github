# Analysis Working Group (AWG2): Context-Aware Risk Metrics


_Focusing on hybrid methodologies (qualitative + quantitative) to define and measure vulnerability in ways communities recognize as legitimate, find actionable, and trust._

This idea and group emerged from the [June 9 Boston-Area Complex Risk Science: Exploring new frontiers and a new community for understanding risk](https://ai.northeastern.edu/event/boston-area-complex-risk-science-exploring-new-frontiers-and-a-new-community-for-understanding-risk) (report [here](https://zenodo.org/records/17122711))

Areas of emphasis include: 
- Facilitated exchange on standard and open data (modeled after [Sylvain Costes’ NASA AWGs](https://www.nasa.gov/osdr-working-groups-awg-charter/))
- Scientific journal articles (not white papers unless there is a perceived gap in the perspectives)
- Connection between social and infrastructural vulnerability
- Where quantitative analyses are possible/robust and where qualitative approaches are required (when and where to transition between them for a given project focus)

Guiding Questions:
- How do we capture what is meaningful and vulnerable in place-specific contexts?
- What are the literacies needed to translate across technical, institutional, and social boundaries?
- How might we represent social vulnerability as a network?
- Where and when do we need to transition from quantitative to qualitative approaches to risk?
