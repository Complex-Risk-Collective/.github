Building collective intelligence and shared capacity through commons-based communities to understand, govern, and transform complex socio-ecological-technological systems for a resilient and flourishing future.


# About
We are cultivating collective intelligence and cooperative capacity to understand, govern, and transform complex socio-ecological-technological systems for resilience and flourishing.

This organization serves as an open, evolving commons for researchers, practitioners, and institutions working at the intersection of complexity science, risk analysis, and collective governance. Our repositories host tools, data, and frameworks for analyzing interconnected risks (e.g,. compounding and cascading) and for translating those insights into decision support, policy, and design.

Through collaboration, openness, and shared stewardship, we aim to advance a new mode of scientific practice‚Äîone that matches the complexity of the challenges we face and builds the cooperative capacity necessary for a flourishing world. 

The Complex Risk Collective is a 'research group' for the future--a new mode of scientific collaboration capable of responding to the problems of the 21st century.

# Principles

Our work is guided by the following shared commitments:
- Interdependence - Acknowledge the interconnectivity between our systems and our sciences and adopt methods that can better represent their connections and interactions.
- Responsivity - Identify methods that permit individuals and communities to create practicable knowledge amongst irreducible extreme uncertainty.
- Openness ‚Äì Knowledge and tools are shared as public goods.
- Participation ‚Äì Plural communities co-create insights and solutions.
- Reflexivity ‚Äì We design with awareness of uncertainty and systemic feedback and with knowledge of our own activities and interactions. 
- Ongoing - We resist hardened ideologies and strive to sustain an open and capacious conversation (dialectic) that can open new possibility and lead to adaptive capacity. 
- Commons Governance ‚Äì Stewardship replaces ownership in sustaining shared capacity.
- Flourishing ‚Äì Science and technology are means toward societal and ecological well-being.
