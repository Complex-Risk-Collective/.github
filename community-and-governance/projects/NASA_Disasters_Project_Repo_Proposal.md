## 1. Project Summary
Create a multi-hazard quantification system and working directly with power grid partners to translate the system's capabilities and information into decision-support products across the disaster management cycle. This is itself a multifarious, multi-step undertaking, requiring interdisciplinary scientific knowledge, frontier data science, and uncommon cross-sector partnership. This piece is not being addressed elsewhere and is unlikely to be.

**Example:**  
Use complex network analysis and artificial intelligence in a generalizable graph-based approach to quantify and predict risk to the power grid and to work in direct partnership with power grid managers and operators at local (southern California), regional (the California Independent System Operator), and national (North American Electric Reliability Corporation) scales to translate the multi-hazard quantification system risk predictions into decision-support products across the disaster management cycle.

## 2. Alignment with Organizational Mission
The electric power grid is one of the most important, and ironically also among the least well-specified, systems affected by multiple interconnected hazards. Three barriers hold back the preparedness and protection of the power grid, and the communities dependent on it, to multi-hazard phenomena:
1. An Earth system science approach;
2. Integrative data to apply the understanding and instantiate existing multi-hazard frameworks;
3. Powerful co-creative partnerships between scientists, data scientists, and power grid managers and operators.

## 3. Scope and Deliverables
The overall Goal of this project is quantify and reduce risks to the electric power grid due to compounding and cascading hazards
(broadly, multi-hazards), achievable by three Objectives:
- Assess knowledge content of multi-hazard data for decision making;
- Quantify the impact of the unexplored multi-hazard system of space weather (extra-terrestrial), terrestrial weather (meteorological), and wildfire (climatological) for their individual and joint impact on the power grid and because they cover multiple 'families' in the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR)'s Integrated Research on Disaster Risk (IRDR) categories of hazards;
- Produce decision-support products across the disaster management cycle and validate their utility with California power grid utilities, regional power system operators, and national grid management organizations.
