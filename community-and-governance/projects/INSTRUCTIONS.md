Welcome! This document explains how to propose a new repository or project within the **Complex Risk Collective**.

---

## Step 1: Review the Organization Guidelines

Before starting, please familiarize yourself with:  

- [Organization README](../../README.md) – Overview, mission, and commons structure 
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) – Principles for contributions and collaboration  
- [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) – Community norms and expectations  (_forthcoming_)

---

## Step 2: Complete the New Project Proposal Template

1. Navigate to `community-and-governance/projects/NEW_PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md`.  
2. Make a **fork** of the repository (or clone locally) and copy the template.  
3. Fill in all sections of the template, including:  
   - Project title, proposers, and date  
   - Project summary and alignment with mission  
   - Scope, deliverables, and repository structure  
   - Dependencies, licensing, and contributors  
   - Proposed collaboration and communication channels  

> Tip: Be clear and concise. Include links to datasets, tools, or related repos when relevant.

---

## Step 3: Submit the Proposal

1. Create a **new branch** in your fork with a descriptive name, e.g., `new-project-space-weather`.  
2. Commit your completed proposal template to this branch.  
3. Open a **Pull Request (PR)** against `community-and-governance/projects/` in the main organization repo.  
4. In your PR description, provide a brief rationale and highlight any reviewers or experts to consult.  

---

## Step 4: Review and Approval

- **Core maintainers** or the **governance team** will review the PR.  
- They may request clarifications, edits, or discussion before approval.  
- Once approved, the PR is merged and the new repository may be created under the organization.  

> Note: Approval ensures alignment with the organization’s mission, standards, and open-source principles. It is not a limitation on scientific creativity.

## Step 5: Initialize Your Repository

After approval:  

1. Create the repository under the organization (or ask a maintainer to do so).  
2. Initialize it with the standard folder structure (`/docs`, `/src`, `/data`, `/notebooks`, `/results`, `/governance`).  
3. Add appropriate LICENSE, README, and CITATION files.  
4. Notify contributors and working groups of the new repository.  

---

## Step 6: Ongoing Collaboration

- Use **GitHub Discussions** for coordination and idea exchange.  
- Submit **issues and pull requests** for improvements, bug fixes, and new features.  
- Maintain reproducibility, documentation, and proper attribution.  
- Refer to `/community/governance/` for any questions about decision-making or working group formation.

By following these steps, you help maintain a **transparent, inclusive, and sustainable commons** for advancing complex risk science.
