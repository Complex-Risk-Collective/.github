# Enhancing Power Grid Resilience through Multi-Hazard Analyses and Dynamic Responses

[NASA Disasters Program Project](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/disasters) awarded in 2025. PI: Ryan McGranaghan


## Project Overview

A record drought and a relentless heat wave have pushed the electrical grid to its limit as homes struggle to stay cool. Then, a powerful solar storm strikes sending ground currents surging through the earth, damaging transformers and triggering rolling blackouts. These in turn ignite wildfires in several locations. Coordination efforts falter as the fires grow and further damage to the power infrastructure ensues. 

What appears to be a stroke of bad luck was, in truth, a predictable and likely catastrophe without coordinated knowledge of multi-hazard interaction. 

We now experience the precarity of the power grid to the Earth and space system with increasing frequency (cf. the massive electricity generation failure in the state of Texas due to extreme winter conditions in 2021 and even more recent events such as the May 2024 power outages caused by thunder and hail storms coupled with extreme heat in Houston) exacerbated by changing magnitudes and frequencies of extremes such as the space weather storm in May 2024 that was the largest on record since 2003, creating geomagnetic effects and aurora into the southern US, and the statistic that eight of the 10 largest wildfires in California history have occurred in the last five years.

This NASA project directly addresses a vital, unmet national-scale challenge: creating a rigorous multi-hazard quantification system and working directly with power grid partners to embed this information into decision-making processes across the disaster management cycle.

## Project Goals and Objectives

The overall **Goal** of this project is to **quantify and reduce risks** to the electric power grid due to compounding and cascading hazards (multi-hazards).

This is achievable through three specific **Objectives**:

1.  **Assess Knowledge Content:** Evaluate the existing knowledge content of multi-hazard data for its utility in decision-making.
2.  **Quantify Multi-Hazard Impact:** Quantify the individual and joint impact on the power grid of the unexplored multi-hazard system consisting of **space weather** (extra-terrestrial), **terrestrial weather** (meteorological), and **wildfire** (climatological). This combination covers multiple 'families' in the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR)'s Integrated Research on Disaster Risk (IRDR) hazard categories.
3.  **Produce and Validate Decision-Support Products:** Create decision-support products spanning the disaster management cycle and validate their utility with California power grid utilities, regional power system operators, and national grid management organizations.

## Innovation and Technical Approach

Our effort proposes to become the state-of-the-art in multi-hazard analyses by integrating data from meteorological, climatological, and extra-terrestrial hazards within a rigorous data-driven framework.

### Core Technical Innovations:

* **Integrated Data & Framework:** We will develop a generalizable graph-based approach using complex network analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) to unify diverse Earth system science data into a multi-hazard framework.
* **Risk Quantification and Prediction:** This system will quantify and predict risk to the power grid from compounding hazards, moving beyond siloed, single-hazard assessments.

### Partnerships:

A key component of this project is the direct, co-creative partnership with power grid managers and operators at local, regional, and national scales, including:
* Southern California utilities
* California Independent System Operator (**CAISO**)
* North American Electric Reliability Corporation (**NERC**)

This collaboration is essential to translate the multi-hazard system's risk predictions into actionable decision-support products.

## Addressing Systemic Barriers

This project directly tackles the three main barriers that hold back the preparedness of the power grid to multi-hazard phenomena:

1.  **An Earth System Science approach:** By explicitly quantifying the interconnectedness of space weather, terrestrial weather, and wildfire hazards.
2.  **Integrative data to apply the understanding:** By creating a frontier data science approach to unify data streams and instantiate existing multi-hazard frameworks.
3.  **Powerful co-creative partnerships:** By establishing direct, sustained collaboration between scientists, data scientists, and power grid stakeholders.

## üåê Knowledge Commons

This project is intended to be a contributing part of a **Knowledge Commons** that is taking form around Complex Risk Science. We commit to open sharing of non-proprietary data products, methodologies, models, and decision-support framework concepts with the broader research community, disaster risk reduction organizations, and relevant public stakeholders to empower resilience efforts.
