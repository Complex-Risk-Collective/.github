# Contributing to the Complex Risk Collective

Welcome! This organization is an open, distributed commons for advancing knowledge, tools, and community around complex, interdependent hazards and socio-ecological-technological systems.

We encourage contributions from a wide collectivity: scientists, engineers, policymakers, community practitioners.

Your participation helps us build collective intelligence, cooperative capacity, and shared governance across a distributed research ecosystem.

# Principles for Contribution

Openness and Transparency – Share work openly while providing clear attribution.

Collective Stewardship – Contributions strengthen the commons; act with shared responsibility.

Dialectic – We prioritize dialogue, co-creation, and equitable participation.

Atmosphere of intellectual friendship – Contributions should recognize the value of plural epistemic, technical, and institutional perspectives.

Reproducibility and Rigor – Code, data, and documentation should support replication and clear understanding.


# How to Contribute

1. Contributions can include:
    - New datasets or analytic workflows
    - New repositories representing kindred projects or contributions to existing repositories
    - Documentation and visualization tools
    - Policy translation and decision-support frameworks
    - Governance and collective action frameworks/updates
    - Discussions and conversations
    - Case studies or [storylines](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-018-2317-9) or [imaginaries](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13280-021-01544-8)



2. Contributing to Existing Repositories
    - Fork → Branch → Pull Request

      Use standard GitHub workflows. Ensure your PR includes a description, rationale, and, where relevant, tests or example notebooks.
      
    - Discussions
      
        Propose new ideas, ask questions, or coordinate experiments via the repository’s Discussions tab.
    - Issues
      
        Report bugs, gaps, or opportunities for improvement. Include reproducible steps when relevant.


3. Creating New Repositories or Projects. If you wish to initiate a new repository or subproject:
    - Ensure the project aligns with the mission of the organization (multi-hazard, complex risk, or community capacity-building).
    - Draft a short project proposal in the `community-and-governance` repository (template provided). Include:
        - Project goals and scope
        - Intended contributors
        - Dependencies or links to existing repos
        - Open license choice
        - Submit a pull request to `community-and-governance/projects/` for review and discussion. Approval by the core team is required before the repository is created.
        - Once approved, create the repository under the organization and follow the standard folder structure.


# Documentation and Standards
- README – Describe project goals, context, and usage.
- LICENSE – Choose a permissive open license (MIT, Apache 2.0, or CC-BY for data/docs).
- CITATION.cff – Include to enable proper scholarly attribution.
- Directory Structure – Follow the organization template (docs/, src/, data/, notebooks/, etc.).
- Testing & Reproducibility – Ensure analyses and scripts are reproducible with clear dependencies.

 
# Governance & Decision-Making

- All repositories fall under the umbrella of commons governance.

- Major decisions (project approval, license choice, or organizational policy) are made via consensus discussion among core maintainers, documented in `community-and-governance` (description forthcoming).

- Analysis working groups may be formed for specific initiatives; membership is open and voluntary.

# Acknowledgement & Attribution
